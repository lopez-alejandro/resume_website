            <p><strong>Hello,</strong> thanks for visiting my site. I'm a second year student at the University of Southern California studying Computer Science and Computer Engineering (CSCE). I am currently on the hunt for a summer internship in either Los Angeles or San Francisco. You might have seen me at E3 2014. I am available for phone and in-person interviews but would rather meet up for coffee to discuss my possible role in your company.   
            </p>
